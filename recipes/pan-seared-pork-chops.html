    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These pan-fried pork chops truly have more flavor that you will ever guess. 
        It’s a guaranteed way to make sure that every single bite of pork chop disappears from your plate. 
        This basic recipe is living proof that a few simple ingredients can create amazing results in the kitchen. 
    </p>
    <p>
            I’ll walk you through best pork chop cuts, pork chop basics and how to achieve that perfect sear. 
            Perfectly cooked pork chop is always cooked to a nice medium instead of the shoe leather texture 
            and is pinkish inside.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pork chops, (thick in size)</li>
        <li>Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, for searing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat chops dry with the paper towel and sprinkle them very generously with Italian seasoning, salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat your skillet (I recommend cast iron one) to medium high and add the olive oil. When it's shimmering hot and not a moment before, add your chops.</li>
        <li>Sear on one side, without moving them at all, until they are nice and golden brown on the first side, about 3-5 minutes. Flip and sear the other side until browned.</li>
        <li>The easiest way to check if the pork chop is done is to use meat thermometer. When they reach an internal temperature of 135 F degrees they are done.</li>
        <li>Remove them from the skillet and let them rest on a plate for 10 minutes, during which time they will continue cooking with the residual heat and will eventually reach 145 F degrees.</li>
        <li>Do remember that cooking time can vary based on the thickness of the pork chops.</li>
    </ol>
